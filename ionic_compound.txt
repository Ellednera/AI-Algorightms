Generating Ionic Compounds 

(using CSP)

1. Get all elements (separate as anions and cations)
2. Include some compound anions and cations
3. Get all their charges registered
4. No suitable chemistry module available for this simple task
[consider the charges too, simplify them if necessary :) ]

Foward tracking
1. Get current listing of cat- and anions (one from each group)
2. Try combining them and check for existance (individually)
3. Combine them + process for output 

Backward tracking
1. Cross all elements 
(if not then use array+for loop, but this method will be very slow)
2. Check for existance one by one (each cross product)
3. If the compound exists, then process them for output

Solution
There are 2 different ways to solve these problems.
1. Normal programming method, create everything then do checking
2. Create+Checking in one go for each combination :| This might cause the code to be hard to understand
3. Cross products will be generated using the Set::CrossProduct module

Data
1. Elements and their corresponding charges stored into a hash
2. Existing elements stored into another hash (to ease the checking process, this saves time compared to using array)
OR :)
Use a hash table for the existing ionic compounds ie everything is in one hash table
