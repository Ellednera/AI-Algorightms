Some working algorithms

Currently includes:
1. Constraint Satisfaction Problem solving

 - __cons_stat.pl__ is the primitive way of doing it, while __cons_stat_timing.pl__ has another way more efficient way of doing it. __cons_stat_timing.pl__ is the benchmarking of the two different approaches.
 - __ioninc_compound.txt__
   - The general idea of how to implement the codes to generate ionic compounds randomly plus checking for the ioninc compound's existance.
   - Will be implementing forward-checking and back-tracking methods
   - If successful, this might end up as a stand-alone program. It might be moved to a new repository and made into a module too :)
